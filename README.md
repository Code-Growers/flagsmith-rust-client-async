# Disclaimer
This is a async version of the official Flagsmith Rust SDK (based on Tokio runtime) + minor tweak in type of `default_flag_handler` to allow context. It was created because crate [flagsmith-async]([flagsmith-async](https://crates.io/crates/flagsmith-async)) has not been updated over 2 years.

It follows the same logic as original SDK, just some methods are now async instead of blocking.

# Flagsmith Rust SDK Async

> Flagsmith allows you to manage feature flags and remote config across multiple projects, environments and organisations.
